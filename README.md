# Flappy Bird With Smart Pipes üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Outliers


### Team Members

### Project Description
A useless twist on Flappy Bird: the pipes dodge the bird, and the bird can auto-save itself with smooth transitions.  
Enjoy wild vertical movement, smart obstacles, and questionable usefulness!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Birds keep crashing into pipes in games.  
Why not make the pipes avoid the bird instead?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We coded pipes that move their gaps to dodge the bird, and gave the bird a smooth auto-save feature.  
Now, it‚Äôs almost impossible to lose‚Ä¶ unless you try!
